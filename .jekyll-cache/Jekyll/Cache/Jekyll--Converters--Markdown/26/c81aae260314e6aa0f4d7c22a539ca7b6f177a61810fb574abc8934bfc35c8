I"‘<p>I spend much of my time sshâ€™ed into a remote machine (my schoolâ€™s high performance computing cluster) and often come across .csv files that Iâ€™d like to view. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>, although fast, does not handle .csvâ€™s in any special way, and if the .csv is not short and simple, can result in unintelligible output. I was recently diving through my organizationâ€™s .bashrc and found this handy script.
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/google/code-prettify@master/loader/run_prettify.js"></script></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
function pcsv() {

cat $1 | sed -e 's/,,/, ,/g' | column -s, -t | less -#5 -N -S

}
</pre>

<p>which results in some pretty nicely formatted output.</p>
